<p>This was my first car. My grandfather had broken down Saab 9-3 1999, which he allowed me to sell so I can buy some car.</p>
<p>The budget was very tight, so there was not a lot of options. Together with my father we checked some VW Golf's, Passat's, but their condition was really bad. After some days we found this red Mazda 626, which looked much better and the price was in the budget. So, we decided, to take it.</p>

<p>From a financial perspective, this car was really inexpensive for me, because my dad did all the maintenance and repairs. So I was only paying for gas.</p>
<p>At the end it had some engine problems, it was not going well. Sometimes on overtaking it lost power and made really bad situations on the road.<br />I owned it 1 - 2 years, then I sold it in our local craigslist portal.</p>
