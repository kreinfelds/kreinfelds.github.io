<h2>Power list</h2>
<p>Do every day simple task and try to win the day. Live in present and think about future, don't live in past events and past actions. Try to be better and do the work today and now.</p>
<h2>Consistency</h2>
<p>Be consistent with you work. Don't try to find instant result, feedback. Success is a journey and it is a long road there. Be consistent!</p>
