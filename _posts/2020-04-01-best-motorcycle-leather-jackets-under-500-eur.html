<h1>Looking for the best motorcycle leather jacket under 500 EUR</h1>
<p>My requirements:
  <ul>
    <li>High quality leather</li>
    <li>Price under 500 EUR</li>
    <li>Popular brand</li>
    <li>Looks great</li>
    <li>Practical for everyday use</li>
    <li>Possibility to add leather pants for track days</li>
    <li>CE Level 2 armors in shoulders, elbows and possibility to add back armor</li>
  </ul>
</p>

In 2019 I passed motorcyle exams and got motorcyle driving licence. Prior that I didn't have any motorcyle related expierence so I didn't know much about gear.
As a budget for gear was limited, I found a good deal on used Rebelhorn Hiflow III textile two piece suit size S. It was a little bit baggy, I wished it would be more thigther but it was a good deal price wise. After some time I bought a biker jeans because Rebelhorn pants was to baggy and looked like a snowboarede pants. So the most of days I weared Rebelhorn Hiflow III Jacket and Modeka jeans.
Now I am looking to upgrade it to more safer, stylisher leather jacket and pants.

<p>Below is a list of all the jackets I looked at.</p>
