<p>I have found some niche market where I could try to jump in. It is Active Directory tools for sysadmins.<br />Reasons why I like this idea:<br />1. Active Directory is a Windows product<br />2. Those tools are usual in the desktop software form</p>
<p>And it is all because my first programming experience started with Pascal and then Delphi framework. My first job was in the accounting software development company and I was developing lots of Windows forms.<br />I did research to find out if Delphi is good for this AD reporting tool and I found out that Visual Studio is much better. Because VS has already builtin Microsoft AD libraries and I found lots of information on the internet about how to use them.<br />So I downloaded VS 2015, and tried to create some Windows form applications and for surpriseÂ to me, all interface, controls, event system was very similar to my Delphi experience.</p>
