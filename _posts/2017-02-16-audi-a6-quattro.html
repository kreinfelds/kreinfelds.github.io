<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Again searching for a better car. I wanted something more powerful and something newer. This car must be in good visual and technical condition. So I was looking at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A6#C5_.28Typ_4B.2C_1997.E2.80.932004.29">Audi A6 C5 V6</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A8#First_generation_.28D2.2C_Typ_4D.3B_1994.E2.80.932002.29">Audi A8 D2 V8</a>. I studied forums and gathered information about them. A8 was more expensive and it would be more costly to maintain. And looked like A8 was not easy to sell.</p>
<h2>Purchase</h2>
<p>I found Audi A6 C5 1998 with 2.8 V6 engine and four wheel drive. Car looked very clean and was in good condition. But it had the automatic transmission(Tiptronic) and I was skeptical about it. I thought it would not be reliable and would be costly to repair. Problems were that there weren't any good alternatives.</p>

<p>I thought I should give it a try. When I did a test drive, the car felt really good. It really felt like an upgrade from my old Audi. So I liked it and wanted to buy it. After some days or even week, I bought this car.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This Audi A6 was really good purchase. I mainly only did maintenance (oil, brakes, tires, etc.) and there was no need for any repairs. Audi was very well maintained before me. This was the best car that I have owned from a finance standpoint.</p>
<p>Time went ahead, I got a new job and a bigger salary, so again I started to look for my next car. And I sold this car on 15 June 2014.</p>
