<p>I wanted a new car, so I started to check craiglist. I was working in my first job and styding. My budget was tight, so I got into car loan - not very smart decision. Together with my dad we checked couple cars. I wanted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A6#C4">Audi A6 C4</a> 2.8 V6 Quattro manual. We could not findÂ any in good condition or in my budget.<br />Then one day I found a dark green A6 with 2.6 V6 FWD and it looked in pretty good condition. After school, together with dad we check out this car, did some test drives, it looked good and already in next morning I bought it.</p>

<p>I could not find any picture when I bought it. Audi had much nicer 16 inche rims with summer tyres, this one is with winter tyre setup.</p>
<p>In first month car was running with no problems, after that it had some problems with cooling system. We changed thermostat, but we mess up the cooling system there now was some air in system. That made me lot of problems with it in next few months. After some month we did bleeding air from the coolant system.</p>

<p>It head pretty bad problems with rust. To repair it, costs was really high, they were like price of this car own. I tried to do some rust repair jobs by my self, but messed it up even worse.</p>
<p>After owning it for 1 - 2 years, I wanted a newer and rust free car. I selled it on craiglist to car trader, who did some cheap paint job and reselled it.</p>

<p>In summary I would recommend this car as good first car. It was reliable enough and easy, not expensive to repair. I felt safe riding it, cause it was big and comfortable.</p>
