<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>It was beginning of 2014 and I got salary raise. Again I wanted to get a newer, more powerful car. Maybe I was just bored with my old car.</p>
<h2>Purchase</h2>
<p>Spring came, I was just like usually checking used car market and found this blue Audi A6. And in that moment I decided that I want this car. It looked good in pictures with black rims and tinted back windows.</p>
<p>I started to do research about this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audi_A6#C6_.28Typ_4F.2C_2004.E2.80.932011.29">A6 C6</a> generation. Did not found any big problems with this 4.2 V8 engine and performance data looked very cool (in some sites 5,9 s 0-100 km/h). I was still thinking - some days I thought that this is not a good idea, some days was like 'YOLO' let's go buy it.</p>

<p>So I decided to do a test drive and try to feel how it is to drive a V8. I liked and after some days decided to take it to Audi official dealership for pre-purchase inspection.</p>
<p>Inspection results were not the best. Mostly those problems were about oil leaks, coolant leak, old rubbers, and sealings. Dealer made repair cost estimation to about 1/3 of car price. Seller did not want to repair it and not drop a lot from the price.</p>
<p>So again I was thinking some days and decided to go 'YOLO' mode. I applied for a car financing in the bank and after some days cars was mine.</p>
<h2>Repairs</h2>
<p>I was driving it for week or two, and felt that something is not right. Went to auto repair shop, they did some diagnostic and tell that I should go to specialized gearbox repair shop. Went there and find out there is problems with the transmission. Repaired it and it was expensive.</p>
<p>After that car was constantly in repairs shops average once in a month. It had problems like broken G28 sensor, broken engine supports, coolant leak and broken radiator, broken fuel injectors, problems in the exhaust system, parking sensors failed, etc.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The car was amazing when it was working. But when it broke down, it was not cheap. And it broke down a lot. I really felt in love with V8 power and sound.</p>
<p>But after a lot of repair bills, I decided to make it end. Total repair cost was almost 50 % of car buying price. Which was not really expected. Maybe it was normal for a car this age and class, but I was not ready for it.</p>
<p>Definitely, in future will buy some Audi with V8 again.</p>
<p>I bought it on 28 May 2014 and sold it on 21 September 2015.</p>
