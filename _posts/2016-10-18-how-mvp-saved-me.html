<p>MVP - minimum viable product.</p>
<p>From wiki, "In product development, the <b>minimum viable product</b> (<b>MVP</b>) is a product with just enough features to gather validated learning about the product and its continued development."</p>
<p>My project to-do list was getting bigger and bigger every day. I started to get feeling like I was not progressing and I will not finish this project this month.</p>
<p>I stopped programming and started again to research if this product is really in demand. I started to think about making some smaller tool so I can publish something. I was reading sysadmin subreddit and searching for keywords like "Active Directory reporting". I found some validation for my product and features that I already had built. So I found again motivation to keep programming this AD reporting tool and publish beta version ASAP. Then I made a list of core functionality that I already have and the list wasÂ surprisingly big. There was only some core stuff that I have not totally finished.</p>
<p>So now I am concentrating only on those core functions, leaving the big to-do list aside so I can publish beta this month.</p>
