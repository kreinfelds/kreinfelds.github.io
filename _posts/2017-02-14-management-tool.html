<h2>Management tool - history</h2>
<p>In last two previous jobs, we used project tracking / management tool <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira">Jira</a>. I really liked it and I used it a lot. I always noted down task description and short to do list. And it was very helpful, especially when you needed to check older tasks.</p>
<h2>Before</h2>
<p>Now when I work independently with my projects at the begging I did not use any project management tool. When my task list got bigger and I had more ideas about what to create later, I wrote them down in new Google Drive sheet. After some weeks, maybe months that sheet got really messy, there was too much information, notes, tasks, ideas. I read about <a href="http://Reinfelds.com/index.php/2016/10/18/how-mvp-saved-me/">MVP</a> and tried to reorganize everything. I created a new page and put all important tasks there.</p>
<p>After some time I got the idea to start track time for my tasks. At first, I searched for Jira, but turns out there is no free version. And at this moment, when I do not make any money from my current project this was very important for me. So no Jira for now.</p>
<h2>TeamClerk</h2>
<p>Then after searching and reading reviews, I found <a href="https://www.teamclerk.com/">TeamClerk</a>. It has free version and good UI. I put all my tasks from Google Drive sheet and started to using it. When creating a task you can choose tasks priority(Low, Medium, High), difficulty(Low, Medium, High), and status(Unstarted, started, finished). All tasks are ordered based on priority and difficulty.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>

<p>I really liked Project Analytics tab, where I could see three graphs about task status distribution, finished tasks by day, started tasks by day.</p>
<p>I really liked the UI, it was functional and modern.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
[caption id="attachment_164" align="aligncenter" width="463"]<img class="wp-image-164 size-full" src="http://Reinfelds.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/task_desc.png" alt="TeamClerk " width="463" height="526" /> TeamClerk new task[/caption]
<p>Adding task description was really bad, it was designed for maybe like one short sentence.</p>
<p>There were no time tracking options. Always when I assign a task to me, I get an email about that and that was really annoying.</p>
<p>So basically I stopped using it because of no time tracking and task description problems.</p>
<h2>Trello</h2>
<p>Again after some searching, I found this tool - <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>. It supposes to have time tracking and task description, commenting, checklist options.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<p>Basically, in Trello you can create a board(project page) in which you can create many lists like to do, ideas, etc. And for time tracking you have to use third party tools. Trello offers a lot of third party integrations and those are called Power-Ups (Dropbox, Evernote, GitHub, Google Drive, and much more). For time tracking you have to use Power-Up called "Harvest". I again created my boards, put all task in the respective lists.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<p>I again created my boards, put all task in the respective lists. I tried to use for some days, but I kinda didn't like it. UI was not as good as TeamClerk and time tracking was not easy to use. And switched back to TeamClerk.</p>
<h2>hiTask</h2>
<p>Found this tool - <a href="https://hitask.com">hiTask</a>. Again put all my tasks there. Started using it.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<p>hiTask offers more features the previous tools. You can plan tasks for a specific date, estimate time, make it as repeated task, tag and color tasks.</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<p>I used it for some days and found some things that annoy me. You can order tasks only by alphabet, priority, last modified, start date, due date. I was not using calendar and dates so for me really was only two options - alphabet and priority. Of course, I needed my task to be ordered by priority, but there were only three options.  I had about 40 tasks and I could no distribute them by three priority options.</p>
<p>UI was too complicated for me and there were too many features that I don't need. So I slowly stopped using it.</p>
<h2>KanbanFlow</h2>
<p>Again started my searching adventures. I found - <a href="https://kanbanflow.com">KanbanFlow</a>. I put all my tasks in it and already felt that this is the one.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
[caption id="attachment_167" align="aligncenter" width="566"]<img class="wp-image-167 size-full" src="http://Reinfelds.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/new_task.png" alt="KanbanFlow" width="566" height="571" /> KanbanFlow new task[/caption]
<p>At begging, you can add additional columns for other projects, ideas list, etc. In a task, there is much more space for description than other tools. You can color your tasks by your custom categories, I created colors for every project. In task description, you can use text formatting tags.</p>
[caption id="attachment_168" align="aligncenter" width="571"]<img class="wp-image-168 size-full" src="http://Reinfelds.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/subtasks.png" alt="KanbanFlow" width="571" height="573" /> KanbanFlow subtasks[/caption]
<p>In other task tabs, you can add subtasks(checklist).</p>
<p>The most part that I love is you can you view task description and subtasks. If a task has a description, subtasks then it has these additional icons which you can click and description or subtasks will appear and stay.</p>
[caption id="attachment_170" align="aligncenter" width="441"]<img class="wp-image-170 size-full" src="http://Reinfelds.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/task_gif.gif" alt="KanbanFlow" width="441" height="209" /> KanbanFlow features[/caption]
<p> </p>
<p>To track time you have to use built in widget Pomodoro timer which uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro Technique</a>. You just select one task and press Start. After the time is elapsed, you will receive notification that you need to take a break. Breaks are usually 5 minutes and after four cycles you can take 15 minutes break. And when break time is elapsed, you get a notification that break time is over.</p>

<h3>Cons</h3>
<p>I would like some summary graphs like TeamClerk has. And some reports about spent time, cause now you can only see total day times in work log.</p>
<h2>After</h2>
<p>I am now using KanbaFlow and I recommend it to others. It really helps boost my productivity and all my tasks are well organized. UI is good and easy to use. Pomodoro timer is really useful and I enjoy using it. Premium version is <span class="premiumInfoDialog-dollarSign">$</span><span class="premiumInfoDialog-cost">5 per user and month, it includes some useful features like Time spent report, Cumulative Flow, Cycle &amp; Lead time, Forecasting, Time estimate &amp; Task count and others. In the future, I could upgrade to premium version, cause there are some features that I am missing now in free version.</span></p>
