<h1>Money is an Amplifier</h1>
<p>I watched some video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EntrepreneursInCars">EntrepreneursInCars</a> and there was like a Q/A. Question was, "How people changes when they become wealthier?" and he said, "Money is an amplifier. It makes you more of what you already are".</p>
<h1>My thoughts</h1>
<p>Money itself is uncertain. It is not good or bad. It is the way how people uses it. So it is all up to its owner. If he is good the money will make him better. If he is bad the money will make him even worse.</p>
<p>Beeing more wealthier will not make you a better person if you are not already a good person. So my advice - be a better person now, be happier now. The money will not make you happy.</p>
