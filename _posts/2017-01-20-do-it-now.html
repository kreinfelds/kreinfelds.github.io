<p><strong>Do</strong> things <strong>now</strong>. Don't wish for better times, <strong>do</strong> it <strong>now</strong>. Live in the present, do everything you can <strong>do</strong> <strong>now</strong>. <strong>Make</strong> changes in your habits <strong>now</strong>. Find your road and <strong>walk</strong> it <strong>now</strong>. Don't think about the past, you cannot change it. Learn from it and <strong>make</strong> changes in your life <strong>now</strong>.</p>
<p>Do the little things, that won't bring results instantly. Do them every day and the result will eventually come to you. Do them even when nobody is watching.</p>
<p>Be patient. Be positive, you can do it. You can achieve your dreams.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Plan</h2>
<p>Start with theses steps. Don't rush, start with the first step. And then when you are ready to move to the next step. Make little changes every day.</p>
<ol>
<li>Show up.</li>
<li>Show up consistently.</li>
<li>Show up consistently with a positive outlook.</li>
<li>Show up consistently with a positive outlook and be committed for the long haul.</li>
</ol>
